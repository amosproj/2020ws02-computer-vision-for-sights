### Introduction

With SightScan the user can detect which sights are located on an image they have taken. Images saved on the users' device can be added to the application. SightScan provides information about the name and location of a sight on an image.

### Getting started

Before the detection can be started, SightScan needs to download all necessary data for the city in which the sight is to be detected. In the drop-down-menu the user can choose from all cities that are supported. Upon choosing the user is asked if they want to download the city data. The download starts after clicking **OK.**

1. Click  **Choose City**
2. Choose City from drop-down-menu
3. Click  **OK**

### Choosing an image

Images can be added to SightScan via Drag-and-Drop. This function is enabled by clicking **Enable File Drop**. Now an image saved on the device can be dragged into the marked area on the application. New images can be dragged on top of the one currently displayed. Drag-and-Drop can be disabled by clicking **Disable File Drop**. Before dragging in a new image, the function needs to be enabled again.

1. Click **Enable File Drop**
2. Drag image into marked area
